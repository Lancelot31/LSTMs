This repository includes the tests with the Blocksworld environment and LSTMs
Based on the code of DQN from dennybritz

## Blocksworld environment on OpenAI Gym
I implemented the interface for OpenAI Gym environments for the BlocksWorld environment based on the work of [Slaney and Thi√©baux] (https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~jks/bw.html)

Follow these steps in order to configure the environment:
- Identify your gym installation by running 
```python
import gym
print (gym.__file__)
```
- Copy the file /Blocksworld/classic_control/blocksworld.py to the folder gym/envs/classic_control
- Edit the file gym/envs/__init__.py and add the lines
```python
register(
    id='BlocksWorld-v0',
    entry_point='gym.envs.classic_control:BlocksWorldEnv',
    max_episode_steps=20000,
)
```
- Edit the file gym/envs/classic_control/__init__.py and add the following line:
```python
from gym.envs.classic_control.blocksworld import BlocksWorldEnv
```

- Go to the folder Blocksworld/GENERATOR/bwstates.1 and compile the binary 'bwstates'. Alternatively download the file bwstates.1.tar.gz and compile for your platform.
- Edit the file blocksworld.py and configure the path to the binary file 'bwstates'
